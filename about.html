        <!---------TEXT ABOUT------->
    <div>
        <h1 class="subtitle-about">About</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-about">Set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana in 1983, the season is about the disappearance of Will Byers and the ensuing search for him by family, friends and the local authorities.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-about">Imagined by its creators as an eight-hour blockbuster film, it was inspired by and pays homage to classic genre films of the 1980s — in particular the films of Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter, as well as the novels of Stephen King. 
            The season received critical and audience acclaim and was praised for its directing, acting performances, title 
            sequence, and synth-heavy score.</p>

        <!----------ABOUT SEASON 4-------------->
    
    <div>
        <h1 class="subtitle-about">About Season 4</h1>
            <p id="subtitle-spoiler-alert">WARNING SPOILER ALERT!</p>
            <p class="paragraph-about">Season three wrapped up on an extremely emotional note as Joyce, Will and Jonathan packed up their home in Hawkins and jumped in a removals van with Eleven in tow following Hopper’s death (which wasn’t actually a death).
            Joyce, Will, Jonathan and Eleven, we don’t know where they’re going but with a fourth season on the cards, they’ll be back. Whatever obstacles are thrown at them, the gang always finds a way to reunite and save the day.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-about">There’s also one very big change: Eleven has seemingly lost her powers, unable to even lift her teddy bear off the top shelf of her wardrobe. The Soviets, despite suffering a colossal setback, are not done yet. 
            They have a Demogorgon in captivity – is that evidence that the Gate hasn’t been properly shut, but simply stalled? Or are Demogorgons able to open their own mini Gates/tears in the fabric of reality?</p>
            <p class="paragraph-about">The Duffers revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that season four is “going to open up a little bit… not necessarily in terms of scale, in terms of special effects, but open up in terms of allowing plotlines into areas outside of Hawkins”.</p>

    <!----------------HISTORY---------------------->

    <div>
        <h1 class="subtitle-about">History</h1>
            <p class="paragraph-about">The idea of Stranger Things started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film Prisoners, detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped, 
            and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-about">As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of “childlike sensibilities” they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought 
            the combination of these things “was the best thing ever”.</p>
            <p class="final-paragraph-about">To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered “bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War” such as Project MKUltra, which gave a way to ground the monster’s existence in science rather than something spiritual. 
            This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film Red Dawn came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia. Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, 
            as elements of the series, crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror.</p>
